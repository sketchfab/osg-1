Extension : off 
Creator : Digital Equipment Corporation 
Description : OFF was developed in 1986 by Randi J. Rost at Digital Equipment Corporation's 
              Workstation Systems Engineering for the interchange and archiving of 3D objects. 
              OFF is an ASCII-based format and is independent of languages, devices, and operating systems. 


OFF (Object File Format) is a geometry definition file format containing 
the description of the composing polygons of the 3D object

Object files can be in ASCII format (.off) or binary format (.off with "BINARY").
This appendix describes the ASCII format for object files format. These files
must have the extension .off.


In this release, the .off file format supports only [1..3] dimension (+ optionnal W/4 component).
Notice: I didn't find some examples for full informations on vertex like specs talk about, 
or also for binary version. So binary version is not really tested by real data.
